    Lysergic acid diethylamide is a psychedelic drug that was first synthesized in
    1938 by Albert Hofmann. LSD literally takes you in a ‘trip’ to the deepest
    parts of human consciousness. People can have a spiritual-experience, time
    perception is altered, music feels like heaven, all sensations are heightened.
    However, bad thoughts can also turn to be extremely disturbing,
    <a href="#harm-reduction">read more below</a>  to avoid this!

  <p>
    <a href="http://beckleyfoundation.org/science/substances-methods/lsd/">The Beckley Foundation</a>
    is a pioneer institution conducting cutting-edge research on the therapeutic
    potential of this psychedelic. Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZIaTaNR3gk">scientists</a>
    also believe LSD is a master key to unravel the inner workings of
    consciousness.

      Read our section on dosing and tolerance in <a href="me.html">ME</a> for more
      information.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    As with any drug, the correct dose for you depends on factors such as
    weight, gender, metabolism, whether you have taken the drug recently or
    not, amongst many others.
  </p>
  <h3>How you take it matters...</h3>
  <p>
    LSD is always taken orally and it is only injected for research purposes.
    It is commonly dissolved in blotting paper that can be broken down into
    tabs. other, less common, ways of taking this psychedelic are consuming it
    in the form of
    <a href="https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_dose.shtml">liquid LSD
      and gelatin</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    You should place the tab under your tongue for around <strong>10 minutes</strong>, after
    that, you can safely swallow the tab.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are going to try LSD for your first time or you are using a new
    source, we encourage you to take a low dose to avoid a bad trip.
  </p>
  <h3>How much?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5>Low:</h5>
      <p>25–100 µg (people report feeling some effects with as little as 20 µg)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Medium (common):</h5>
      <p>65–175 µg</p>

      LSD is a very potent drug. A common dose of cannabis (smoked) is around 150
      <strong>milli</strong>grams, whereas a common dose of LSD is around 150
      <strong>micro</strong>grams (1000 times more!). However, accidental overdoses are
      very rare because LSD has a very high safety window (the ratio of the
      typical lethal dose to the effective dose). There isn’t an exact lethal
      amount, since it depends on many variables such as the person and context.
      <br>
      Moreover, products sold as LSD can contain other hallucinogens with a
      smaller safety window, so it's always important to
      <a href=" https://www.reagent-tests.uk/product/lsd-multipack/">
        test it!
      </a>
      Our personal advice is not to take a higher dose than we have recommended
      above, and to save your trips for special and meaningful occasions.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>When do the effect kick in and for how long?</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>START</strong> time below is when you will usually begin to feel the effects
    of LSD from the time when you first take it. <strong>DURATION</strong> is
    roughly the length of time you will experience the effects, after which the
    effects will start to wind down and you might start to feel the calm-down/comedown effects.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h5>Start:</h5>
      <p>30–90 min</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Peak:</h5>
      <p>2–3 hours</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h5>Duration:</h5>
      <p>9–14 hours</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This depends heavily on the person and her/his state. Factors such as heart
    rate and blood pressure or the presence of other drugs in the blood affect
    the time the drug will take to have an effect. A higher heart rate and blood
    pressure than normal would make the effects to kick in faster. This can also vary with
    how much you have taken: the higher the dose you take, the longer the trip will last.

    can be unique (and unpredictable) for each person. This is especially important
    for first-time users of LSD, as mixing drugs could result in a negative experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, combining LSD with cannabis can go either way because cannabis
    has unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with
    psychedelics.

  <p>
    Most classic psychedelics (except for DMT) induce <strong>cross-tolerance</strong>.
    This means that if you take mushrooms one day, and LSD the next, the effects
    of LSD will be reduced. After about 3 days the effects will be very small
    or non-existent. Therefore we recommend that you take prolonged breaks between
    trips.

<h4>Every feeling is enhanced with LSD, this is why you want to plan your trip carefully.</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a href=" https://www.reagent-tests.uk/product/lsd-multipack/">Always test your LSD</a>. Other hallucinogens can be sometimes sold as
      LSD, many of these other drugs have a smaller safety window <i>(i.e. the ratio of the
      typical lethal dose to the effective dose)</i>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Don't try LSD if you are in a bad state and feel a bit down. You
      shouldn't take any drug when you are feeling low, but taking psychedelics
      is probably the worst idea. You can easily fall into a very
      unpleasant rabbit hole.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Try to have a trip-sitter look after you during your trip. Ideally, this
      would be someone who remains sober, has had
      previous experience with psychedelic drugs, and has read this guide! Or, let someone
      you trust know when and where you are planning to take it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Always take it with other people and, whenever it is possible, with familiar
      and kind  faces. Experienced users might start trying it out on their own, often to
      seek artistic or intellectual inspiration.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Set and setting, i.e. the place you choose to take LSD, is extremely important.
      It should be a familiar and safe place. Avoid places that may trigger
      negative feelings for you or unsecure and unsafe locations with a lot of people.
      If possible, prepare the site beforehand with a friend you trust.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Prepare a music list. Check our section: <a href="#LSD-what-listen">What should I listen to?</a>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Gather any items you want to experiment with during your trip (books,
      videos, pen and paper etc.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Don't carry valuables while tripping as it's easier to become disoriented
      and forgetful. Stay hydrated: bring a bottle of water and some light snacks.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

  Scientists, writers, doctors and gurus have written a lot about strategies,

  The LSD experience, even when positive, can often be emotionally
  and physically draining. Many people like to have a free day after taking
  LSD, not to recover from the hangover, but so they can reflect on the
  experience as it helps you to gain an even greater
  insight from the trip. Know yourself!
</p>
<h4>LSD hangover?</h4>
<p>
  You might feel an afterglow for some hours or days or you might feel a bit
  off. People vary a lot on their feelings and mood after the trip. If you
  avoid a bad trip and get <strong>enough sleep, drink plenty of water
  </strong> and <strong>eat a sensible amount of food</strong>, you should wake
  up in your usual state.
</p>
<p>
  You might still feel that the world looks a bit weird after the trip, so
  avoid driving, cycling or doing any risky activities. Wait around 24 hours before doing anything
  that requires your full attention and physical coordination.

<h3 id="LSD-trip">The trip</h3>
<h4 id="LSD-bad-trip">Bad trip</h4>
<p>
  Just as how LSD can heighten positive feelings, it can also enhance negative feelings.
  They can be very
  overwhelming and unpleasant. LSD has also been shown to strongly increase
  psychotic-like symptoms [Ref Carhart-Harris et al., 2016.]
</p>
<p>
  Even though a bad trip can be absolutely terrifying at the time, it
  could lead to beneficial long-term consequences when processed and integrated
  properly [Carbonaro et al., 2016]. In <a href="http://jop.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/08/23/0269881116662634.abstract">
    a survey
  about challenging experiences after taking psilocybin mushrooms</a>, 39% of users who had them said that the experience was
  among the top 5 challenging experiences of their lifetime. Despite having
  those difficulties, 84% reported having benefited from the experience and
  76% reported increased well-being afterwards.
</p>
<p>
  LSD can be very dangerous to people with pre-existing psychotic
  illnesses or those who are highly at risk for developing psychosis. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24132898">Research shows
  </a>that LSD makes existing psychotic symptoms worse and can trigger the onset
  of the full-blown psychotic episode.
</p>
<p>
  A bad trip can occur when taking a low or medium dose, but the chances
  increase with higher doses. Both beginners and experienced users can suffer
  a bad trip, so always take the appropriate preventions.
</p>
<p><strong>During a bad trip, <a href="http://neptune-clinical-guidance.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/NEPTUNE-Guidance-March-2015.pdf">you might feel:</a></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Anxiety</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fear/panic</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dysphoria</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paranoia</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confusion</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disorientation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unwanted thoughts, emotions and memories</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Frightening perceptions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Distressing awareness of physiological processes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feelings about evil forces/existential crisis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Headache</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Each person may find their way of escaping a bad trip: listening to a
  particular song, talking to a certain person, or looking at a pleasant painting.
  We personally recommend lying down in a place without disturbances, close
  your eyes and breathe deeply until you feel better.

<h4>Helping out a friend</h4>
<p>
  If you are taking care of your friends, keep in mind the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Be patient, listen to and observe them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Empathise and express understanding of their fears</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Don't try to guide them. Instead, listen to them and talk them through their
      experience without imposing your own ideas of what ‘should’ be
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Find a more peaceful spot
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Tell them that their bad feelings will pass. It can happen and many
      people before have suffered it
    </p>

  <p class="brain-science-content  boxed hidden">
    LSD increases connectivity between different brain areas and consequently
    decreases the independence of different brain networks. Consciousness is
    pushed towards a more unconstrained, chaotic state. This is thought to be
    responsible for psychosis-like symptoms and altered perception in the short
    term. However, the same ‘loosening’ of brain networks results in more
    flexible patterns of thinking, which may improve well-being in the longer
    term.
  </p>
</div>
<h4>Overdose</h4>
<p>
  Accidental overdoses are very rare because LSD has a very high safety window
  (the ratio of the typical lethal dose to the effective dose). There isn’t an
  exact lethal amount, since it depends on many variables such as the person
  and context. <a href="https://erowid.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd_death.shtml">Estimates of lethal doses of LSD</a>
  are higher than 10 mg (10,000 µg) administered orally, more
  than 100 times a normal moderate dose of LSD (100 µg).
</p>
<p><strong>Seek immediate  medical attention if:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The person collapses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Breathing is irregular and/or shallow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The person is too warm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is blood in his/her vomit</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Do not doubt to call a paramedic if you see or feel any of these symptoms. You will
  not get into trouble.
</p>
<p>
  There has been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4043895">only one human incident</a>
  where the death has been attributed to LSD
  toxicity alone. The quantity of LSD in the blood indicated that 320 mg
  (320,000 µg) had been injected intravenously. Very rare LSD-related
  fatalities usually result from people committing suicide or accidental deaths.
</p>
<h4>Understand the trip</h4>
<p class="side-note">
  In this section <a href="http://www.beckleyfoundation.org">The Beckley Foundation</a>
  and Drugsand.me provide you with a lot of neuroscientific information.
  Let us know what else you want to know about!
</p>
<p>
  A discovery the recent Beckley/Imperial studies have revealed is the shift in the overall connectivity of the brain.
  The connectivity within the networks decreases and the connectivity between
  the networks increases. The whole brain becomes more integrated, allowing new
  functional connections to be formed between brain areas which which normally
  do not ‘speak to each other’.

<h4>Music</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26257162">LSD enhances your emotional response to music</a>, increasing wonder,
  transcendence, power and tenderness of it. LSD and music
  work together to change how your neurons talk to each other, that correlate
  with the long lasting change in personality, such as increased openness and
  optimism (Lebedev et al., 2016).

  LSD intensifies the quality and significance of melodies and lyrics and

<h4 id="LSD-what-listen">What should I listen to?</h4>
<p>
  The powerful influence that music has on your trip can enhance it or make it
  really bad, this is why you should pick carefully the music you listen to
  while on LSD. There isn't a standardized playlist suitable for everyone.
  Follow this advice and adapt it to your taste and the experience you are
  looking for!

    <p>
      Research from the Beckley/Imperial Research Programme has focused on
      understanding how brain processes music under LSD.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first discovery was the influence of music in the activity of the
      parahippocampal cortex. This region lies on the inferior part of the brain
      and runs approximately from your ears to the back part where the area
      involved in vision is. It is involved in emotion, memory and ego/self
      functions.
    </p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Parahippocampal_gyrus_animation.gif" alt="Parahippocampal gyrus animation">
    <p>
      The parahippocampal cortex is part of the
      <a href="#default-mode-network">Default Mode Network</a>. Psychedelics decrease PHC is
      highly connected with the Default Mode Network (DMN), which exerts top-down
      control over the PHC. Psychedelics decrease this DMN control, resulting in
      altered consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      LSD and music allows the PHC to interact more freely with the visual
      system. The input of memories to the visual system – a ‘flip’ in the normal
      direction of information flow – may underlie the reported visions.
      Consequently, there is an increase in mental imagery of autobiographical
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music also increases the chaotic brain activity when on LSD, leading to
      sustained improvements in well-being and life satisfaction and an increase
      in openness after several weeks (Ref. Lebedev, 2016)
    </p>
    <p>
      There is much more to investigate here, and analyses are underway to
      understand neurophysiological processing of distinct acoustic features
      (such as pitch, tempo and timbre) in music under LSD, as well the
      relationship to increased music-evoked emotion. The results are coming soon!
    </p>
    <h4 id="default-mode-network">Default Mode Network</h4>
    <p>
      Normally (without psychedelics) the brain functions in a very organized
      manner, with brain areas forming distinct networks doing their separate
      tasks. There are also higher order networks, one of which is the Default
      Mode Network.
    </p>
    <p>
      The DMN is very important for the conscious experience. It is involved in
      such crucial functions as the introspection, autobiographical memory
      retrieval and maintaining the sense of self. The DMN includes 2 key ‘hub’
      areas (areas that are highly interconnected with other brain regions): the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_cingulate">Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)</a>
      and the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex">medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyperactivity of the DMN has been associated with several mental illnesses
      such as anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Psychedelics
      disrupt the connectivity within this network (aka network integrity), and
      the degree of this disruption is mirrored in the experience of
      ego-dissolution, a loss of sense of self. Another piece of evidence, from
      the Beckley/Imperial results, underlining the importance of this network
      for maintaining the sense of self, is the fact that the degree of neural
      synchrony within the Posterior Cingulate Cortex correlates with the ratings
      of ego-dissolution. Other areas involved in memory and perception show also
      a decreased connectivity. This correlates with individuals’ ratings of
      “ego-dissolution” and “altered meaning”.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, psychedelics reduce DMN’s activity and integrity, which results
      in reduction of its repressive grip over the rest of the brain, allowing
      a more flexible state of consciousness.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4 id="LSD-time">Time</h4>
<p>
  Mental time travel refers to the ability to think about future or past, to
  recollect aspects of past autobiographical episodes or imagine future
  experiences. LSD seems to tune you with the present and it enhances any
  stimuli in your environment. This is why the context where you decide to take
  LSD is extremely important to ensure you have a good trip and avoid a bad
  experience.
</p>
<div class="brain-science">
  <img src="static/images/icons/brain.png" alt="nueroscience info toggle">
  <span class="click-me-tip">Click the brain for neuro-info!</span>
  <div class="brain-science-content  boxed hidden">
    <p>
    Again, the disintegration of the <a href="#default-mode-network">Default Mode Network</a>
    dictates your ability to think (travel) about the past or future on LSD. The
    stronger the disintegration of this network, the fewer thoughts you will have
    about your past. The inability of thinking about your own past can explain
    the experience of ego-dissolution, or a loss of the sense of self when you
    are on 'acid'.  (Ref. Speth, 2016)
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal memories are an integral part of ‘narrative self’- a personal
      story that unfolds throughout one’s lifetime, involving past memories,
      perceived present and imagined future. So, in a sense, if you are forced
      to ‘stay in the present’ then your ego-boundaries dissolve and it becomes
      possible to experience oneness or unity with the world – something that
      successful meditators achieve after years of practice.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4 id="LSD-suggestibility">Suggestibility</h4>
<p>
  Suggestibility is the susceptibility or response to suggestion. LSD strongly
  enhances suggestibility. This means that the realism or vividness of
  suggested situations or scenarios is stronger when you are under LSD.
</p>
<p>
  Why does this matter to you? Again, this is another reason of the importance
  of prior expectations (set) and environment (setting) in determining the
  nature of your experience. You may want to hide or avoid any object or place
  that arises any negative feeling or memory. Similarly, you probably want to
  have around things that already calm you down or bring you good vibes in a
  normal state.
</p>
<p>
  Timothy Leary described it as a ‘period of increased reactivity to stimuli,
  both from within and without, there is an increase in suggestibility’
  (Ref. Leary 1966; Carhart-Harris et.al suggestability paper)
</p>
<h4 id="LSD-loss-of-ego">Ego-dissolution</h4>
<p>
  Ego-dissolution is the loss of the sense of 'self' and the feeling of
  belongingness to the world.
</p>

  <div class="brain-science-content  boxed hidden">
    <p>
      LSD increases connectivity between different brain areas and consequently
      decreases the independence of different brain networks. This results in the
      blurring of the borders between the self and environment. In other words,
      there is a loss of integrity/stability of brain networks. This is observed
      even at a cellular level, this means that neurons that are normally active
      at the same time lose this synchronisation. At the same time, there is an
      increased connectivity between brain networks. A clear example happens in
      the <a href="#LSD-visual-hallucinations">'visual network'</a>.(Ref. Carhart-Harris, 2016)
    </p>
    <p>
      The areas in the brain in charge of <a href="#default-mode-network">the sense of self</a>,
      switching between tasks (salience network link?) and attention/information
      access are in the regions of the brain which show the highest increase of
      activity and connectivity on LSD (Ref. Tagliazucchi, 2016, Ref.
      Carhart-Harris, 2016). The chaotic and interconnected activity of our brain
      on LSD resembles the subjective feeling towards the world.

<h4 id="LSD-visual-hallucinations">Visual hallucinations</h4>
<p>
  A <a href="https://www.reviewofoptometry.com/ce/an-overview-of-hallucinations">visual hallucination</a>
  is the vivid perception of an external visual stimulus that does not exist.
  Trippers usually see a distortion of what they are seeing. Fractals
  (repeated patterns) are a common form of distortion.

    <p>
      The first ever study on the effects of LSD on the human brain by
      <a href="http://www.beckleyfoundation.org">The Beckley Foundation</a>
      explained how people hallucinating with their eyes closed report to see.
      The connectivity of the brain region involved in vision increases its
      activity while on LSD, resulting in an increased connectivity and influence
      of this region with others (Ref. Carhart-Harris, 2016). Moreover, it was
      observed that the visual region of the brain behaves and shows a pattern of
      activity as if it was receiving external visual information - ‘seeing with
      the eyes shut’ (Ref. Roseman, 2016).
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<h4 id="LSD-synaesthisia">Synaesthesia</h4>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/synaesthesia/Pages/Introduction.aspx">Synaesthesia</a>
  is a psychological experience in which two or more senses that are normally
  experienced separately are constantly and spontaneously felt together. For
  example, the word 'Friday' makes the person to see the colour red. The painter
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia_in_art">Kandinsky</a> is a
  famous example of a synaesthete (person with these experiences in their daily
  life).
</p>
<div class="science-brain">
  <p>
    LSD triggers synaesthesia-like experiences. This means that even if you are
    not a synaesthete you may experience a similar sensation. However, the
    experience is different as there is no consistency and specificity in the
    pairing of stimulus-sensation. This means that you might suddenly taste the
    sweetness of the word 'love' once, but not ever again and you might feel
    afterwards how another unrelated word tastes sweet as well. (Ref. Terhune,
    2016) In the contrary, a synaesthete constantly tastes sweet when he/she
    hears the word 'love' and only this word would trigger the sensation of
    sweetness (besides actual sweet food/drink).
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Don't be afraid when you see a noise and enjoy the mind-blowing experience!
</p>
<p>
  If you avoid a <a href="#LSD-bad-trip">bad trip</a>, some particular positive
  feelings seem to be enhanced the most.
</p>
<h4>Language processing</h4>
<p>
  To investigate the effects of LSD on language, done as part of the
  Beckley/Imperial Research Programme, a team asked participants to name the
  pictures immediately after seeing them. Although the reaction times were the
  same as on placebo, study volunteers made more mistakes in naming the
  pictures. For example, when shown the picture of a bus, they were more likely
  to call it a ‘truck’ or a ‘car’. The mistakes were from the similar semantic
  category as the correct answer, but not exactly right. This research explains
  how LSD affects semantic networks and the way the brain draws connections
  between different words or concepts. "The effects of LSD on language can
  result in a cascade of associations that allow quicker access to far way
  concepts stored in the mind," said Family.
</p>
<p>
  Psychedelics help to notice associations people wouldn't normally pay
  attention to, or help form new connections – this has implications for
  enhancing creativity. Ref Family et al., 2016
</p>
<h4>Pro-social effects of LSD</h4>
<p>
  Under the effects of LSD people report a feeling of belongingness to the
  environment, as well as a connection with those who are with them. LSD
  changes the way you read people’s expressions and feelings. Consequently,
  these are internalised differently and your reaction in social context
  differs from your sober state.
</p>
<p>
  To measure the social behavioural changes on LSD, a group of people were
  given LSD while they undertook a series of tasks. The scientists aimed to
  test some traits that influence our social behaviour such as empathy,
  prosociality, emotional response to faces and subjective mood. These were
  assessed twice per individual during the ‘trip’ since it lasts for several
  hours. Ref Dolder et al., 2016

<h3>Dependence and abuse?</h3>
<p>
  LSD doesn’t cause dependence or addiction, and <a href="http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/68/2/264">no physical withdrawal symptoms
  </a>have been described. Scientific
  literature has also reported <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6384428">subtle or nonsignificant changes </a>in the
  personality, attitudes, and creativity of people that have repeatedly

<p>
  <a href="me.html#tolerance">Tolerance</a> develops quickly for LSD compared to
  other recreational drugs. Moreover, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432814004562">
  there is cross-tolerance between</a> LSD and
  all the other psychedelics (except for DMT). This can
  be problematic as the user needs to take higher doses to achieve the same
  effect.
</p>
<p>
  Our personal advice is not to increase your doses far from what we advise and
  save your trips for special and meaningful occasions. Leave at least a couple of weeks between the trips.

</p>
<h3>Long-term effects</h3>
<h4>The good</h4>
<p>
  Research by <a href="http://www.beckleyfoundation.org">The Beckley Foundation</a>
  has shown that psilocybin and LSD increase openness (imagination, aesthetic
  appreciation, non-conformity, creativity) and optimism weeks after the
  psychedelic experience. Psychedelics are thought to be an 'existential
  shock' therapy and can certainly lead to a change in behaviour and outlook.
  After 2 weeks of the experience, the positive effects continue, whereas
  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26847689/">
  the psychosis-like effects don't</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This a good reason to put thought into the mindset and setting of your first trip,
  as it can prove to be a more meaningful experience.

      LSD disrupts the <a href="#default-mode-network">Default Mode Network</a>
      or similarly, it increases the <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2014/10/29/brain-psychedelic-drugs/#.V3fH2flVhBc">randomness in the connections between

<p>
  Many people rate the experience as one of the most meaningful of their life,
  and this experience can catalyse many positive changes, such as
  <a href="http://jop.sagepub.com/content/28/11/983.short">quitting smoking</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063972">
    Recent studies</a> have <a href="http://jop.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/02/25/0269881114568039.abstract">
      found that</a> psychedelic use was associated with lower
  rate of mental health problems. Of course, we deem that to be due to correlation and not
  causation as there are many other factors involved.
</p>
<h4>The ugly</h4>
<h5><strong>Hallucinogen Persisting Perceptual Disorder (HPPD) and flashbacks</strong></h5>
<p>
  Scientists still don't agree if Hallucinogen Persisting Perceptual Disorder
  (HPPD) and flashbacks are the same or different things; we need more
  research! HPPD is a legitimate disorder featuring in DSM-V, but nevertheless,
  this condition still remains poorly defined and studied. We still do not know
  how many people suffer from it, and what makes people vulnerable or optimal
  ways to treat it, as was recently summarised <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26421858">
  here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Both result in a re-experiencing of one or more of the psychedelic effects
  time after trying this drug (months or years). The main difference between
  HPPD and flashbacks is that the former is a distressing medical condition,
  while the latter can be experienced as either positive or negative. People
  with HPPD experience visualizations  that are frequent, and impinge upon
  their daily lives. Flashbacks are meant to be intermittent, infrequent
  experiences, whereas HPPD are described as more persistent states. However
  often both terms are used interchangeably.
</p>
<p>
  As you might understand if you decide to try this drug, this can be very
  disturbing in your everyday life. Visual effects seem to be more prominent
  (geometrical hallucinations, flashes or intensification of colour, movements,
  afterimages, trails and haloes).
</p>
<p>
  If you think you have HPPD/flashbacks, don't hesitate to look for medical help.
